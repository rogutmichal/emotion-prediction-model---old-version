# Emotion Analyzer AI

## Machine Learning Text Emotion Classification Application

Emotion Analyzer AI is a full-stack application that uses **ML.NET** to analyze text and predict emotional states.

The system allows users to enter any text and receive probability scores for six different emotions.

The project consists of:

- **Blazor Web App** - user interface
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** - backend API
- **ML.NET Machine Learning Model** - emotion prediction engine
- **Docker** - containerization
- **Render** - cloud deployment

# Features

## User Interface

- Modern Blazor Web App interface
- Text emotion analysis page
- Real-time prediction results
- Emotion probability visualization
- Responsive design


## Machine Learning

The model recognizes six emotions:

- sadness
- anger
- love
- surprise
- fear
- joy


The prediction returns:

- detected emotions
- confidence percentage
- probability ranking

# How It Works


1. User enters text in the Blazor application

2. Frontend sends request to ASP.NET API

3. API passes text to the ML.NET prediction service

4. Machine learning model analyzes the text

5. The application returns probability scores for every emotion


Example:

Input:

```
I was nervous at first, but after seeing the results I felt incredibly happy.
```


Output:

```
joy        85.20%
fear       8.10%
surprise   4.20%
sadness    1.50%
```

Model:

- ML.NET
- LightGBM multiclass classifier
- Text featurization
- n-gram extraction
- class weighting

## Model Performance

The model achieved **90.40% accuracy** on an independent test dataset (`test.txt`).

The best-performing emotion classes were:

- **love** – 96.23%
- **surprise** – 93.94%
- **anger** – 93.82%

# Test Results (`test.txt`)

The model was evaluated on an independent test dataset containing **2,000 samples**.

## Overall Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Micro Accuracy | **90.40%** |
| Macro Accuracy | **91.79%** |
| Log Loss | **0.2610** |
| Correct Predictions | **1808 / 2000** |

## Per-Class Accuracy

| Emotion | Accuracy |
|---------|----------|
| anger | 93.82% (258/275) |
| fear | 88.39% (198/224) |
| joy | 88.49% (615/695) |
| love | 96.23% (153/159) |
| sadness | 89.85% (522/581) |
| surprise | 93.94% (62/66) |
